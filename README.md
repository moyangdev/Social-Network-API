## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 
This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Technologies used include Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Instructions
<b>User Story:</b><br />
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

<b>Acceptance Criteria:</b><br />
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```
## Mock-Up
The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia. <br/>
